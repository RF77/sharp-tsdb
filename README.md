# sharp-tsdb
Vision of a C# time series DB with a Roslyn Scripting interface and focused to house automation

Just starting the development! NO idea if ever released.

Focus on:
 - Usage in a private house automation
 - very flexible query language over C# Scripting and Roslyn
 - query editor like the RoslynPad
 - Add-On for grafana
 
No focus on:
 - clustering
 - heavy loads
 - transactions
 - large DBs over 10GB
 - Multi-Platform
